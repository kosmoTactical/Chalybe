# Chalybe
This topdown dungeon crawl is built on PyGame Zero, the simple yet powerful Python module for making simple 2D games. Chalybe is LAtin for "Steel", and the objective is to defend yourself from enemies whilst picking up Beryllis. Get to the end and fight the boss! In Progress, help or advice is welcome. kosmotactical@gmail.com
